I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the Colorado School of Mines. My advisor is <a href="http://inside.mines.edu/~twilliams/">Dr. Tom Williams</a>. My current research interests include human-robot interaction (particularly verbal noncompliance and clarification interactions), robot ethics, natural language generation (especially pragmatics), and machine learning to detect and disambiguate euphemistic speech. After graduating from Colorado College in 2016 with a computer science major and a minor in discrete math, I completed my Master's degree in computer science at the Colorado School of Mines. For my Master's thesis, I applied machine learning techniques to the task of extracting ostensibly private information from the encrypted traffic between an Amazon Echo and its servers. I have since been working towards my doctorate. I've enjoyed the opportunity to TA for several classes at Mines, including Computer Science 101, Introduction to Linux, and Computer Vision. When I'm not working, I'm climbing every rock I can find.<BR>
